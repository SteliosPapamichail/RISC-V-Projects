# RISC-V ISA Projects
This is a collection of programs I wrote in Assembly for CPUs that use the RISC-V ISA. All assembly scripts were written inside the <a href="https://github.com/TheThirdOne/rars">Rars</a> simulator & some of them can be passed into the <a href="https://github.com/mortbopet/Ripes">Ripes</a> simulator to get a better graso if the RISC-V pipeline.
